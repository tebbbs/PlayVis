# Final Year Project

All source code is available in this folder, along with demoSongs.json which contains the Spotify API data for 500 songs from my library.

PlayVis is a webapp, so it must be served by a server and accessed in a browser.

The code has been built, and can be served from the folder ./build with any webserver, e.g. serve or lite-server, both of which are available from npm (Node Package Manager)

Alternatively, the code found in ./build is hosted at [playvis.web.app](playvis.web.app).
